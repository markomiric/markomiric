### Backend, Cloud & Gen-AI Builder 🛠️☁️🤖

👋  Hi, I’m Marko — turning raw documents & tough specs into resilient microservices and smart copilots.  
🧠  Recent wins:  
   • Automated invoice ingestion → OCR + LLM extraction → draft bookkeeping entries (80 % faster).  
   • Built a RAG engine for an invoicing-automation platform:** accountants can type “What is the payment due date for invoice #4523?” and receive an instant answer sourced from scanned invoices, supplier contracts, and payment-terms data.
🚀  Fav tools: FastAPI • Spring Boot • LangChain • AWS Lambda • Docker.  
🌱 Shipping compact, fine-tuned LLMs as serverless micro-APIs, with Prometheus + Grafana tracking their pulse.  
⚡ Fun fact: I treat latency like high-interest technical debt—the longer you ignore it, the steeper the price.

💌  Let’s connect & build something awesome!
